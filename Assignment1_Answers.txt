Python - Assignment 1

### 2.Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 1000 and 1200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma separated sequence on a single line."""
#type(x)==int:
#type(y)==float:
for x in range(2000, 3200):
  if (x%7)==0:
		y=x/5.0
		if (y%5)!=0:
			print str(x)+",",  #coz u cant contacate an int+a string, so convert int to str then contacate

Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.

# Python Program to find Volume and Surface Area of Sphere
 
PI = 3.14
radius = float(input('Please Enter the Radius of a Sphere: '))
sa =  4 * PI * radius * radius
Volume = (4 / 3) * PI * radius * radius * radius
 
print("\n The Surface area of a Sphere = %.2f" %sa)
print("\n The Volume of a Sphere = %.2f" %Volume)
